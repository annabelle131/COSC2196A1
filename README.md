# Project Ideas

The project in my mind is a mobile app that is aimed to help people to raise the awareness of the common mental health issues, also provide suggestions to the best timing of the daily activities to improve user's mood.

The app is named WellBeing Community and it is a Wellness Technology App which can help people to achieve a happier life. Every morning, when people are waking up they will have an inevitable mood in their mind sometimes it may due to their dreams. Sometimes the mood is good and sometimes the mood is bad. This App was created by us to assess people’s moods which will take about 3 minutes to complete by during the sign-up surveys. After that WellBeing Community will deliver a sure result. This result is not fake; it is based on Cognitive Neuroscience. The WellBeing Community App is a Serious Game project.

This game is very interesting and useful. Because mental health is a big health issue all over the world. I do really care about this health problem and also care for this mobile game project. I believe this project can collect the valuable information of people and they may be relating the mental wellness issues. The information can reflect on their mental health wellbeing. The WellBeing Community’s aim is making people more aware of the unforgettable, the important and the valued part of their lives, to find the most beautiful part in their heart. And also every client will ask to build an avatar to protect privacy and increase the security levels when they share any information with other members of this project.

People’s privacy and security will be our main concern and all the information will be fully encrypted. The avatar will keep you secretly when it is allowing clients sharing their assessments to friends or other members of this game.

Every day the clients login and take the surveys, the app has been starting to build the Mood Calendar. The details of people’s mood and it reflect people’s mental wellness by the calendar.

The WellBeing Community app provides the mood analytics that people need to complete their health assessment. It can also transport you into the new 5G of personal connectivity. I believe that people connect their home environment will be able to adapt to their moods hence to help them enrich the clients’ lives according to by their Mood Calendar. The project will predict which days can be the best days for the meeting, dating, decision taking, parties and also other activities. The WellBeing Community app will be a multicultural project, it is born in Hong Kong where the mood problems are very common when people have no intention to seek medical advice. This is a serious issue. As we know, Hong Kong is a fast-paced city that can make people stressful. The premier version will be released in English first and simplified Chinese first.

I’m planning to use unity development skills to provide a quality result for our game. Unity is the best game development tool to build high-quality 2D or 3D games include our mobile app game.

This game is easy to play; it can be provided to many ages people. As long as you can use a smartphone.
I strongly believe there is an obvious need for a mind and mood app collecting mental wellness data. And now, I have already developed a prototype of this Wellness technology project. Implementing this technology project to enhance users’ experience and interface is my next goal. I’m planning to make it online by March 2020. If the WellBeing Community project is successful, I believe it can help people to manage their mental wellness, hence it may be preventing mental problem issues.
